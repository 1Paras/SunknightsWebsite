_**<u>New Members’ guide into Sun Knights</u>**_
1.  Make sure you have the Sun Knights symbol in your name both in-game and in discord. _Copy and paste:_ ❂
2.  When you start chatting, you may notice that you got a 1+ level. That is our bot which adds EXP as you talk. Every time a minute passes, you get a random number of EXP. EXP is needed to get a higher level.
3.  You may find that some people have colored names and roles, these are earned either by:
    *   Getting to a certain level while chatting.
    *   Getting enough points (explained [here]({% url 'pointguide' %})).
4.  Finally, you may notice that for our announcements, events, current servers and daily quests, we tag **@Event Notify**. To be notified on events and other cool things, do `+selfrole Event Notify` to toggle whether you are mentioned for events or not!
5.  You may also notice that we have a lot of channels. If they get confusing, do `+selfrole Organizers` in <mention>#commands-music</mention> to toggle organization channels.
