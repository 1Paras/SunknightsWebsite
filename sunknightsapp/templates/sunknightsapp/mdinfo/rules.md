**Rules**
1.  Do not be disrespectful towards other members, regardless of whether they are at a lower role than you or not.
2.  Keep this server civil. This means no trolling, spamming, abusing bot commands, teasing, immature behaviour, insults, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia or xenophobia.
3.  Anything which is considered as NSFW is not allowed. Keep this chat PG-13. Remember, our clan has a very wide age range.
4.  Do not impersonate others in-game or in discord in order to get them in trouble.
5.  Make sure you are easily taggable. This means having regular text in either your nickname or username.
6.  Manipulating staff is not allowed in any way. This means messaging multiple record managers in order to get as many points as possible.
7.  Swearing is allowed, but not to a high extent. Avoid it as much as possible.
8.  Under no circumstances should a non-staff member use **@Event Notify**. If you want to have your link be in #current-server-link just tell a supervisor.
_Please note: Evasion of punishments given by Staff members will result in a heavier punishment, which ultimately may lead to a permanent ban._
